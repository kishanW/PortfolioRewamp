							STAR JOHNSON ANNOUNCES RUN FOR 3RD DISTRICT STATE SENATE SEAT <br>
							Host Interactive Facebook and Twitter Live Discussion
							<hr>
						</h5>
						
						<b>Canal Winchester, OH (December 10, 2009)</b>  Star Johnson, a Democrat, officially announced her candidacy that she is running for 3rd District Senate Seat in 2010. There is much to be done in the areas of education, public safety and health care. Johnson also adds that, this election year will be about some significant decisions on important issues now and for the future of the 3rd District.

						Her platform includes a plan to help make the 3rd District one of the best in the state for all of its citizens. To be a great District means safe streets and strong schools, and economic development that provide quality jobs. Johnson believes that her campaign would seek to inspire a public conversation on critical issues and viable solutions that will reflect the views and wishes of its residents in the District; rather than only dealing with the wishes of the special interest.

						Johnson has an extensive record of public service with several community nonprofits organizations. Her experience in public service, through volunteerism in the local hospital, years of outreach to the homeless, hungry, and abused throughout the community involvement with various faith missions clearly demonstrate her passion for the people. She is undoubtedly a real person with real experience. Star Johnson has pledged to advocate for the invisible citizens throughout Ohio. She stands as a voice for those who are often forgotten.

						Star Johnson has created www.abrighterohio.com and is hosting "Interactive Facebook /Twitter Talk" beginning December 16, 2009 from 7 pm - 8 pm at www.facebook.com/abrighterohio , where all are encouraged to join and participate in a roundtable discussion with Johnson. Volunteers are needed and welcome to join Star Johnson in working towards a brighter Ohio.

						Johnson is a Columbus, Ohio native and a graduate of Columbus Alternative High School. She received her Bachelors of Science in Marketing, from Franklin University and she is currently working on her Masters in Organizational Management. She has two children and lives in Canal Winchester.
