						<h3>Economy</h3> 
						
						Economy is among Star Johnson's top priorities. She strongly believes that in order to boost this sector, well-paying jobs in Ohio must be created and maintained by fostering government stimulus. Johnson believes in the immense possibilities of small businesses and therefore aims to encourage and support entrepreneurs.  <br><br>
						Johnson proposes tax incentives to assist small and large businesses. She explains, "I support tax incentives that will create jobs [by] offering longevity throughout our Ohio's communities." In doing so, she promotes a viable solution to overcome Ohio's economic crisis. She intends to work in partnership with the private sector, as well as with non-profit organizations. <br><br>
						Furthermore, Johnson stands for the further restructuring of the economic system. She strongly believes that moving the budget is not the solution to the declining economy; she plans to identify the main causes of Ohio's recent downfall, which hinder our communities' economic turnaround. <br><br>
						Johnson is determined to take Ohio's issues to Capitol Hill and fight to provide economic relief to Ohioans, as she cannot predict Federal Government support. Although maintaining and creating well-paying jobs represents a challenge, Johnson believes it is possible. <br><br>
						With more than ten years of experience in the management sector, highly promising political-force Star Johnson is committed to providing jobs and to improving the lives of her beloved Ohioans. She is not afraid of the challenge, being eager to work hard to overcome the bad economic situation from which an overwhelming number of Ohioans suffer. <br><br>
						Star defines herself as a common citizen, who deeply understands the effects of the current economy. Johnson declares, "I share the same concerns you share, I believe our stories are different, but our pains are the same." She concludes, "I am here to serve people." <br><br>

						<h3>Education </h3> 
						Being the force that turns on the economy, education is fundamental to achieving good quality of life. Therefore, affordable high-quality education for children and adults is extremely important. Star Johnson is highly devoted to improving the current education system; her objective is to enhance the teaching quality offered at Ohio's public schools. <br><br> 
						Johnson emphasizes the need to focus on math and science, improving these programs and making them more globally competitive.  She believes that each Ohioan deserves to have access to outstanding education, a goal achievable by increasing funds destined to education. <br><br>
						Johnson also highlights the importance of supporting children with special needs. She is aware of the special attention these children need which, among other necessities, include psychological aids. She plans to designate funds to improve the quality of life of these children and their families. <br><br> 
						Furthermore, Star Johnson is a promoter of equal educational opportunities to provide neglected groups with the tools necessary for success. She wants every Ohioan to be able to receive quality education. Star stresses the bold connection between education and a flourishing economy: "Better quality education equals better jobs." One of Star's most deeply-rooted philosophies state that educated Ohioans are better prepared for the challenges that will arise in the 21st century. <br><br>

						<h3>Security  </h3>
						Star Johnson takes notice of the importance of supporting local police force because local law enforcement has a 
						direct impact in the country's homeland security. Johnson claims that "our police task forces face local, national, 
						and international threats on a daily basis. These elite men and women lay their lives on the line daily to ensure 
						the safety of our freedom."  Johnson appreciates and recognizes the heroic services that members of the police 
						force perform to protect our families. Star wants to designate more funds for the police force, increasing the 
						number of police officers to provide a safer environment.  Johnson claims, "We cannot compromise our local 
						security." She has noticed the direct relationship between crime and a poor economy; therefore, a decrease crime 
						rate is also associated with Johnson's economy- and education-related programs.<br><br>

						<h3>Healthcare  </h3>
						Through volunteerism in local hospitals, Star Johnson became aware of the multiple necessities of Ohio's 
						health sector. Johnson promotes universal healthcare, based on the principle that every Ohioan deserves 
						affordable, high-quality, and adequate health care coverage. She believes in a health care system, one 
						affordable to each member of our community. 
						Johnson wants to work in partnership with employers, individuals, and government to improve the current 
						healthcare system. She knows that these ideals are not easy to achieve, especially because of the current 
						healthcare crisis that affects our working families. However, she has a strong commitment to ensuring affordable 
						and outstanding healthcare services for all Ohioans. <br><br>

						<h3>Civil Rights  </h3>
						Star Johnson is an active promoter of equal rights. Johnson deeply believes that further work is necessary 
						to enact efficient legislations and, in doing so, ensure equal rights for all individuals. Johnson believes 
						that discrimination should be punished by law.  Committed to fighting for equal rights for all Ohioans, Johnson 
						wants to protect Ohioans from hate crimes, employment, racial, and gender discrimination.  Besides, Star Johnson 
						believes enacting legislations to protect gay partners is necessary. By striving to establish helpful laws, Johnson 
						wants to fight against all kinds of discrimination, whereas it is on the base of race, religion, color, sex, age, 
						national origin, or disability.  <br><br>
