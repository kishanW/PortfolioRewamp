				Every year on Patriots Day, Heather Abbott and her friends take the train from Providence, R.I., to Boston and watch the Red Sox game before meeting other friends for drinks. The 38-year-old and two girlfriends had just arrived at a bar on Boylston Street and were waiting in line when Abbott heard an explosion near the finish line of the Boston Marathon.
				<br><br>
				"I remember turning around and looking and seeing people screaming", Abbott said Thursday at a press conference at Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital in Boston. "I was on the ground, everyone was running to the back of the bar to the exit. I felt like my foot as on fire and I knew I couldn't stand up."
				<br><br>
				After multiple surgeries, Abbott was faced with a choice - trying to save her badly mangled foot or amputating her leg below the knee. She opted for the latter, saying that her foot was unlikely to ever be functional and her leg would be shorter than the other.
				<br><br>
				"I wouldn't be able to live the lifestyle I did prior to the injury," she said. "Although the prosthetic is going to be something to get used to, I think it's a better chance of living my life the way I used to."

					does not load the image, the background is just silver I had a previously-written CSS header, 
					and wanted to substitute an image for the background of the heade.
